        So... this is a little embarassing but it looks like nemestats.com just blew up in your face. We've logged the error so hopefully we'll fix it soon. Feel free
        to <a href="https://github.com/NemeStats/NemeStats/issues/new" target="blank">open a GitHub issue</a> if you are willing to provide additional details so we can
        better troubleshoot. Sorry for the inconvenience!
