<h4>
	To make it easy and fun to record the results of board games so you can get interesting
	statistics, Achievements, and Badges.
</h4>
<br />
<p>
	My name is Brian Baker (BGG: <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/profile/HolisticDeveloper">HolisticDeveloper</a>) and I am
	the current owner and maintainer of NemeStats. I discovered NemeStats around 2018 through its integration with the wonderful
	<a href="https://www.bgstatsapp.com/">Board Game Stats</a> app. I loved the idea of adding a "meta layer" to game night and
	quickly introduced it to my group as a fun way to keep track of rivalries and the "best" gamer in the group.
</p>
<p>
	NemeStats was originally built by Jake Gordon (<a href="https://github.com/jakejgordon/" title="See Jake's GitHub profile">GitHub</a>)
	because he loved board games and software development. A group of co-workers played board games nearly every day at work and
	were keeping track of wins/losses on a whiteboard -- as he had come to believe many people do. He had been wanting to start
	a project outside of work just to brush up on some new technologies and figured he might as well build a web application to
	track the results of board games... and NemeStats was born!
</p>
<p>
    Our shared goal is to build a site that is fun, easy to use, and compelling enough that board gamers will want to record the results
    of their played games so they can get statistics that go way beyond just simple win/loss ratios. NemeStats requires that each game
    has each player's rank recorded. This opens up the opportunity to do much more advanced statistics like "How often do I beat a
    given player on a given game with a given number of players?" or "Who is the best at a particular game?" or "What is my average
    rank across any number of given games?" or even "Who is my Nemesis?".
</p>
<p>
    NemeStats already has a system for calculating gaming points -- or "NemePoints" -- in a way that attempts to measure the quality of
    wins that a player achieves. For more information on NemePoints, <a href="@Url.Action(MVC.Home.AboutNemePoints())" title="Learn more about NemePoints">check out the About NemePoints page</a>.
</p>
<p>
    For information on Badges and Achievements, <a href="@Url.Action(MVC.Home.AboutBadgesAndAchievements())" title="Learn more about Badges and Achievements">check out the About Badges and Achievements page</a>.
